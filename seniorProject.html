    <h1>The Difference Engine</h1>
    <p>The Difference Engine was designed by Charles Babbage.  During his time, women would be used to write mathematical books.  Babbage noticed that there were many errors within the book and that if the books were created by machines, the books would contain less mistakes.  So he decided to do that, make a machine that would get rid of the need for humans ot manually write out the mathematical books.  (Connor help with the wording please.  I see words, but they don't make sense.)</p>
    <p>The Difference Engine design was finished, the problem came when the physocal one was being made.  It took to many resources (silver and metal).  When Babbage tried to get more funding, he was declined.  So he was only able to make one piller of the greate Difference Engine.</p>
    <p>Recently, a very wealthy person wanted the Difference Engine to be physically made, so he funded a project to create it.  The original design was so amasing, there were around twelve modifications people from the current time had to make.</p>
    <p>The inital design had many creative elements of the design.</p>
    <p>One of these design elements is how the Difference Engine kept track of the digits.  A piler was used to represent a digit.  It would keept track of a number until it reached 10 and the one would be carried and restart at 0 again.  <a href="seniorProjectSmall.html">Example</a></p>
    <p>Babbage decided to not use deciamsl for two reasons.  The first is that people wouldn't necissarly need decimal answers in the book.  The second reason is that it would provide as a defence mechinism.  If a number piller tried to be a decimal, it would be a instant warning that something went wrong with the machine.</p>
